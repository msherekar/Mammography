# CNN MODEL FOR MAMMOGRAPHY AI.

1.) Data preprocessing and integration of pipelines.

2.) Integration of real and synthetic datasets to enhance CNN robustness and generalization.

3.) Transfer learning experiments using ConvNeXtV1. 

4.) Image augmentation, weighted sampling, and cost-sensitive learning strategies.

5.) Optimization of  CNN models through hyperparameter tuning. 

6.) Performance evaluation (ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, uncertainty analysis)
